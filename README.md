# DAT325-Data-Valid-Quality-and-Cleaning
This course focused on the importance of high-quality data and how it relates to business requirements. 
This course taught me how to explain the characteristics of data quality, assess the quality of data sets through the application of industry-standard best practices, and how clean data by applying appropriate tools and techniques without adversely affecting data integrity. These skills were put on display in the form of three projects. In project one, I developed a Data quality plan which explained why high-quality data is important to an organization, how high-quality data helps meet organizational goals, and the data quality characteristics. Project two is an Executive summary report for a dataset that included finding anomalies, data types, and specific transformations needed to join the data. Project three is when data validation was done to the Twitter Airline dataset. The dataset was cleaned and validated using excel.
